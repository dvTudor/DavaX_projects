# - There is a tech conference, and attendees are listed for three sessions:
# testing, development and devops.
# - Each attendee can choose one or more sessions.
# testing = {â€œAna, "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"}
# development = {"Charlie", "Eve", "Frank", "Ana"}
# devops = {"George", "Ana", "Bob", "Eve"}
# - Find attendees who attended all three sessions.
# - Find attendees who attended only one session.
# - Check if all testing attendees are also in the devops session.
# - Get a set of all unique attendees and sort them alphabetically.
# - Create a copy of the development set and clear the original.
